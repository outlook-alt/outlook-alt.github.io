<h3>EIA -2020 CONCERNS</h3>
Respected Sir/Madame,
<p>
Consider this email as the voice of lacs of backward communities from tribal and forest areas, citizens living in urban centres and student fraternity. The draft Environment Impact Assesment notification of 2020 which is set to replace that of 2006 have provisions which are bound to have drastic repercussions on ecologically sensitive zones, forestry and wildlife of India. <br>
First up, the stringent clause of rendering an industrial project as illegal provided it deliberately escapes the govt. scrutiny and licensing, which EIA notification 2006 contained have been reduced to the project's promoter merely paying fines and continuing with the project anyway. Consequences of this, even a layman can understand very well where, profiteering interests of billionaires is being prioritised over the already flouted environment concerning laws existing until now.<br> 
Two, the provision of reducing time, from 30 to 20 days, for filing petitions by affected communities against an insensitive project will lead to their concerns being unheard leaving the industrial giant free to exploit their land and livelihood. <br>
Third, the extention of time limit for filing project updates on the part of industries from an earlier every 6 months to that of 1 year will essentially keep them unchecked for any ill concerned project expansions they might venture into. 
Not to mention other full assessment and  strategic concerns. <br>
The feedback, open upto 30th June have seen various environment activists, student groups and NGOs voicing their non - affirmative opinions for this notification. Upholding the spirits of democracy, as India have always strived for, would only mean taking into account all of them and many more to come before enacting the provision and do an irreversible damage to the ecology and hence future of India. 
</p>
<p>Looking forward to an accountable, amended EIA-2020.</p>

Sincerely
